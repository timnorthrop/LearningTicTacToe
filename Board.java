 * interface Board specifies all methods needed
 * to interact with a 2D structure in a generalized
 * manner.
 * 
 * implementations of this class should provide
 * a constructor that is passed the dimension for the
 * 2D array.
 * 
 * Note:  the design of this interface stems from the
 * class discussion leadup to this assignment and is
 * a result of the design decisions made in that planning
 * session.
 * 
 * In addition you may want to add methods to your 
 * implementing class that are particular
 * to a Tic Tac Toe board including
 *      // return a list of available move positions
 *      public List<Integer> getAvailableMoves ()
 *      // return true if the target character forms a WIN in Tic Tac Toe
 *      public boolean check(char target)
 *      // other methods if you determine they are needed
